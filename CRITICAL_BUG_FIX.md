# CRITICAL BUG FIX - Template Literals Broken

## ⚠️ What Was Wrong

When I replaced all dollar signs ($) with Cedis symbols (₵), it accidentally broke JavaScript template literals throughout the code.

### The Problem
JavaScript template literals use `${variable}` syntax, but the find-and-replace changed them to `₵{variable}`, which broke:
- Category filtering
- Product links
- Dynamic styling
- Page navigation
- And many other features

### Example of the Bug
```javascript
// BEFORE (Correct):
<Link to={`/products/${product.id}`}>

// AFTER Replace (Broken):
<Link to={`/products/₵{product.id}`}>
```

This caused all category links to show "Electronics" or not work at all.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Files Repaired (10 files):
1. ✅ `src/pages/HomePage.jsx`
2. ✅ `src/pages/ProductsPage.jsx`
3. ✅ `src/pages/ProductDetailPage.jsx`
4. ✅ `src/pages/CartPage.jsx`
5. ✅ `src/pages/CheckoutPage.jsx`
6. ✅ `src/pages/user/OrdersPage.jsx`
7. ✅ `src/pages/user/WishlistPage.jsx`
8. ✅ `src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.jsx`
9. ✅ `src/pages/admin/AdminProducts.jsx`
10. ✅ `src/pages/admin/AdminOrders.jsx`

### What Was Changed
Replaced all instances of `₵{` with `${` to restore proper JavaScript template literal syntax.

**IMPORTANT**: Price displays still show ₵ correctly (e.g., `₵299.99`). Only the template literal syntax was fixed.

## 📋 Technical Details

### Template Literals in JavaScript

Template literals are a JavaScript feature that allows embedding expressions:

```javascript
// Correct syntax:
const url = `/products/${productId}`  // ✅ Works
const price = `₵${product.price}`     // ✅ Shows: ₵299.99

// Broken syntax (what happened):
const url = `/products/₵{productId}`  // ❌ Broken
```

### The Fix

Used find-and-replace to restore correct syntax:
- Find: `₵{`
- Replace: `${`

This fixed the template literals while keeping price displays as Cedis.

## ⚠️ Lesson Learned

When doing global find-and-replace:
- ❌ Don't replace `$` globally in code files
- ✅ Only replace in display strings
- ✅ Preserve template literal syntax `${}`
- ✅ Test thoroughly after global changes
