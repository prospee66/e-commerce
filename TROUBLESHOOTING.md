# Troubleshooting Guide - Navigation Not Working

## Issue: Navigation Links Not Functioning

If clicking on "All Products", "Electronics", "Fashion", etc. doesn't do anything, follow these steps:

---

## ✅ Step 1: Check if the App is Running

### Is the development server running?

Look at your PowerShell/Command Prompt window. You should see:

```
  VITE v5.0.8  ready in 543 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

**If you DON'T see this:**

The app is not running. Start it:

### Option A: Command Prompt (Recommended)
```cmd
cd "C:\Users\LIFE GOES ON\Desktop\e comerce site"
npm run dev
```

### Option B: Double-click START.bat
1. Navigate to the project folder
2. Double-click `START.bat`

---

## ✅ Step 2: Check Your Browser

### Open the correct URL:
- The app runs at: **http://localhost:3000**
- Make sure you're visiting this exact URL
- **NOT** just opening the HTML file directly

### Check browser console for errors:
1. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
2. Click the **Console** tab
3. Look for any red error messages

**Common errors and fixes:**

**Error: "Module not found"**
→ Solution: Run `npm install` in the project directory

**Error: "Failed to fetch"**
→ Solution: Make sure development server is running

**Blank page or white screen**
→ Solution: Check console for errors, try hard refresh (Ctrl + F5)

---

## ✅ Step 3: Test Each Navigation Link

The navigation has different behaviors:

### Public Links (Work without login):
- ✅ **All Products** → Goes to `/products`
- ✅ **Electronics** → Goes to `/products?category=electronics`
- ✅ **Fashion** → Goes to `/products?category=fashion`
- ✅ **Home & Garden** → Goes to `/products?category=home`
- ✅ **Sports** → Goes to `/products?category=sports`
- ✅ **Custom Request** → Goes to `/custom-requests` (Now public!)

### What Should Happen:
1. Click a link
2. URL in browser should change
3. Page content should change

### If Nothing Happens:
- Check browser console (F12)
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled
- Try a different browser
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)

---

## ✅ Step 4: Verify Installation

### Check if dependencies are installed:

```cmd
cd "C:\Users\LIFE GOES ON\Desktop\e comerce site"
dir node_modules
```

**If you get "File Not Found":**

Dependencies are not installed. Install them:

```cmd
npm install
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for installation to complete.

---

## ✅ Step 5: Hard Refresh

Sometimes the browser caches old code. Force a refresh:

- **Windows**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Shift + R`

Or manually clear cache:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Clear data"
4. Refresh the page

---

## ✅ Step 6: Check Navigation Visibility

### On Desktop (screen ≥ 768px):
- Navigation should be visible below the search bar
- Should show all 6 links horizontally

### On Mobile/Tablet (screen < 768px):
- Navigation is hidden by default
- Click the hamburger menu (☰) in top right
- Links appear in dropdown

### To Test Screen Size:
1. Press **F12** to open DevTools
2. Click the **device/responsive icon** (looks like a phone and tablet)
3. Select "Responsive" and set width to 1024px
4. Navigation should now be visible

---

## ✅ Step 7: Complete Restart

If nothing above works, do a complete restart:

### 1. Stop the server:
- Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal/command prompt
- Confirm by pressing `Y` if asked

### 2. Clear everything:
```cmd
cd "C:\Users\LIFE GOES ON\Desktop\e comerce site"
npm cache clean --force
```

### 3. Reinstall:
```cmd
npm install
```

### 4. Start fresh:
```cmd
npm run dev
```

## ✅ Quick Test Script

Run this to test if everything works:

```cmd
cd "C:\Users\LIFE GOES ON\Desktop\e comerce site"
echo Testing Node.js...
node --version
echo Testing npm...
npm --version
echo Testing dependencies...
npm list --depth=0
echo Starting app...
npm run dev
```

## 🔍 Diagnostic Checklist

Use this to identify the issue:

- [ ] Node.js is installed (v18+)
- [ ] npm is installed
- [ ] Dependencies are installed (`node_modules` folder exists)
- [ ] Development server is running (see Vite message)
- [ ] Browser is at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Browser JavaScript is enabled
- [ ] Browser console shows no errors
- [ ] Screen width is at least 768px (for desktop nav)
- [ ] Navigation links are visible on page
- [ ] Clicking links changes URL
- [ ] Page content changes when clicking links

## 📱 Mobile Navigation

On mobile devices or narrow windows:

1. **Look for the menu icon (☰)** in the top right corner
2. **Tap/click the icon** to open the menu
3. **Navigation links appear** in a dropdown
4. **Tap any link** to navigate

The navigation is **intentionally hidden on small screens** to save space. This is standard mobile design practice.

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

### Check these common issues:

#### Issue 1: "This site can't be reached"
**Cause:** Development server not running
**Fix:** Run `npm run dev`

#### Issue 2: Links visible but not clickable
**Cause:** CSS/JavaScript issue
**Fix:** Check browser console for errors, clear cache

#### Issue 3: Links click but nothing happens
**Cause:** React Router not loaded
**Fix:** Check console for module errors, reinstall dependencies

#### Issue 4: Page reloads instead of navigating
**Cause:** Using `<a>` tags instead of `<Link>`
**Fix:** Already fixed in code, hard refresh browser

#### Issue 5: 404 Page Not Found
**Cause:** Route not configured
